# Pressure Tables

Timed practice of multiplication tables with increasing pressure

#### How to Play

1. Select which table(s) you want to practice, or all.
2. Select initial difficulty.
3. Start drilling.
4. Gain points for each correct answer
5. Lose points for each wrong answer
6. Lose points as time passes
7. Win when you reach 100
8. Difficulty increases one level
9. Can't go below 0.

#### State

1. tables
2. difficulty
3. score
4. time since last answer

#### Design decisions

1. **easy and intuitive** vs **hard**. Some multiple choices where the answer
can be easily guessed because none of the others are close. To develop number feel over
rote memorization. But the hard ones are needed to ensure that the tables actually are memorized.

#### TODO

* Bing! or buzzer audible feedback for answer
* don't pick tables at random - instead create an array with each element in the table
(2 - 9) and doubles for 6-9 and shuffle that array.
